# Jarvis Python Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant project that simulates conversational interaction and basic command handling through a command-line interface. The project demonstrates Python program structure, user input handling, and modular design.

## Features
- Command-line based interaction
- Simulated AI-style responses (mocked for demonstration)
- Simple music command handling using a local music library
- Modular code structure for easy extension

## Project Structure
- `main.py` – Entry point of the application and main interaction loop
- `client.py` – Handles simulated AI responses
- `musicLibrary.py` – Manages a simple music library and playback logic

## Tech Stack
- Python

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Clone the repository or download the source code
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
